# RequirementParser

I developed and used this tool for managing the requirements of a large Software Development project in which I was involved. The tool enabled to perform really well structured requirement engineering: Thinking was more easy and documenting to since it only required the shell.

The output of the documenting is saved in a csv file and be used for Textminning/Analysis. Which is required for the type of large scaled project that I did.
